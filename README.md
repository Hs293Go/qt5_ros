# Qt-Ros (FORK FOR QT5 COMPATIBILITY)

Ros Documentation and Tutorials: http://wiki.ros.org/qt_create

## Overview

Includes templates and create scripts for quickly developing qt-based ros packages.

* catkin_create_qt_pkg for quickly templating a qt-ros package.
* Includes a master chooser as a docking element.

## Status

Hs293Go has ported this package to be compatible with Qt5

## Future Work Ideas

* Check if we still need cmake support for mingw's static builds.
* Support more templates.
* Spin off into a separate python module.
* QDesigner elements.
